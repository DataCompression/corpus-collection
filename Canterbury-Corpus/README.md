# The Canterbury Corpus

This collection was developed in 1997 as an improved version of the Calgary corpus. The files were chosen because their results on existing compression algorithms are "typical", and so it is hoped this will also be true for new methods.

The [paper in DCC '97](https://corpus.canterbury.ac.nz/resources/report.pdf) (Adobe PDF, 99Kb) explains how the files were chosen, and why it is difficult to find "typical" files. This collection will not be changed so that it can be used as a benchmark in future.

There are 11 files in this corpus:
